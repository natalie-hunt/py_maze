### Maze generation and solving

Uses depth-first search to generate mazes.


## Usage
```
$ python maze.py [WIDTH] [HEIGHT] [ALGORITHM]
```
Where WIDTH and HEIGHT are the dimensions of the maze grid and ALGORITHM specifies the creation algorithm.
Choices for ALGORITHM are currently DFS for depth-first search and BFS for breadth-first search.

Note that this program uses Python 2.7

## Get it
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nathan-hunt/py_maze
