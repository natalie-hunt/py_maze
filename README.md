### Maze generation and solving

Uses various graph spanning algorithms to create and solve mazes.

## Included creation algorithms
Prim's Algorithm
Kruskal's Algorithm
Depth-First Search

## Included solution algorithms


## Usage
```
$ python maze.py [WIDTH] [HEIGHT] [ALGORITHM]
```
Where WIDTH and HEIGHT are the dimensions of the maze grid and ALGORITHM specifies the creation algorithm
